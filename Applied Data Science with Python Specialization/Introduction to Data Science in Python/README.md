# [Introduction to Data Science in Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-analysis)
This is an online course offered by University of Michigan on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). This is a part of Applied Data Science with Python Specialization.<br><br>

This course was great. I learned the basics of <b>numpy</b> and <b>pandas</b> from this course. And in this repository, I am adding the code I wrote for the assignments.<br><br>

And special thanks to DIU for giving me the opportunity to complete coursera courses for free in this quarantine.
